**Author:** Cintya Huaire  
**Date:** 2023-03-02

## Overview

This repository contains an analysis of social inequality, focusing on the influence of parental social status on children’s expected social status. The analysis is based on the PISA 2018 dataset.

## Dependencies

The following R libraries are required to run the analysis:

- tidyverse
- dplyr
- haven
- descr
- corrplot
- stargazer
- knitr
- kableExtra

## Data Source

The primary dataset used in this analysis is the PISA 2018 dataset, which can be found [here](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/).

## Structure

The analysis is divided into several sections:

1. **Data Preparation**: This section involves loading the PISA dataset and preparing it for analysis, focusing on data from Japan.
2. **Excercise 4.1**: Formulation of a hypothesis on the influence of parental social status on children’s expected social status.
3. **Excercise 4.2**: Estimation of OLS-regression models with expected social status as the dependent variable.
4. **Excercise 4.3**: Analysis of patterns by gender.
5. **Excercise 4.4.a**: Discussion on factors that may be on the causal pathway between parental social class and own social class.
6. **Excercise 4.4.b**: Discussion on potential problems related to measurement and sample that could have affected the analysis.
7. **Annex**: Contains the actual R code for the analysis.

## Running the Analysis

To run the analysis, ensure you have all the required libraries installed. Load the PISA 2018 dataset and execute the R code provided in the Annex section.

## References

Throughout the analysis, various references are cited to support the findings and hypotheses. These references include sources from the World Bank, World Economic Forum, Statista, and academic journals.
